    # The peers section tells MetalLB what BGP routers to connect too. There
    # is one entry for each router you want to peer with.
    peers:
    - # The target IP address for the BGP session.
      peer-address: 10.0.0.1
      # The BGP AS number that MetalLB expects to see advertised by
      # the router.
      peer-asn: 64512
      # The BGP AS number that MetalLB should speak as.
      my-asn: 64512
      # (optional) the TCP port to talk to. Defaults to 179, you shouldn't
      # need to set this in production.
      peer-port: 179
      # (optional) The proposed value of the BGP Hold Time timer. Refer to
      # BGP reference material to understand what setting this implies.
      hold-time: 120
      # (optional) The router ID to use when connecting to this peer. Defaults
      # to the node IP address. Generally only useful when you need to peer with
      # another BGP router running on the same machine as MetalLB.
      router-id: 1.2.3.4

    # The address-pools section lists the IP addresses that MetalLB is
    # allowed to allocate, along with settings for how to advertise
    # those addresses over BGP once assigned. You can have as many
    # address pools as you want.
    address-pools:
    - # A name for the address pool. Services can request allocation
      # from a specific address pool using this name, by listing this
      # name under the 'metallb.universe.tf/address-pool' annotation.
      name: my-ip-space
      # Protocol can be used to select how the announcement is done.
      # Supported values are bgp and arp.
      protocol: bgp
      # A list of IP address ranges over which MetalLB has authority,
      # expressed as CIDR prefixes. You can list multiple prefixes in
      # a single pool, they will all share the same BGP settings.
      cidr:
      - 198.51.100.0/24
      - 192.168.0.0/16
      # (optional) If true, MetalLB will not allocate any address that
      # ends in .0 or .255. Some old, buggy consumer devices
      # mistakenly block traffic to such addresses under the guise of
      # smurf protection. Such devices have become fairly rare, but
      # the option is here if you encounter serving issues.
      avoid-buggy-ips: true
      # (optional, default true) If false, MetalLB will not automatically
      # allocate any address in this pool. Addresses can still explicitly
      # be requested via loadBalancerIP or the address-pool annotation.
      auto-assign: false
      # (optional) A list of BGP advertisements to make, when
      # protocol=bgp. Each address that gets assigned out of this pool
      # will turn into this many advertisements. For most simple
      # setups, you'll probably just want one.
      #
      # The default value for this field is a single advertisement with
      # all parameters set to their respective defaults.
      bgp-advertisements:
      - # (optional) How much you want to aggregate up the IP address
        # before advertising. For example, advertising 1.2.3.4 with
        # aggregation-length=24 would end up advertising 1.2.3.0/24.
        # For the majority of setups, you'll want to keep this at the
        # default of 32, which advertises the entire IP address
        # unmodified.
        aggregation-length: 32
        # (optional) The value of the BGP "local preference" attribute
        # for this advertisement. Only used with IBGP peers,
        # i.e. peers where peer-asn is the same as my-asn.
        localpref: 100
        # (optional) BGP communities to attach to this
        # advertisement. Communities are given in the standard
        # two-part form <asn>:<community number>. You can also use
        # alias names (see below).
        communities:
        - 64512:1
        - no-export
      # (optional) The full network over which MetalLB is advertising
      # with ARP. All CIDRs (above) in this address pool must be
      # contained in this network. MetalLB will not allocate the
      # network and broadcast IPs of this network, even if they are
      # contained in one of the available CIDR prefixes.
      #
      # The default value for this field is the /24 network that
      # contains all of this pool's CIDR prefixes. If no such /24
      # exists because the CIDRs span multiple /24s, arp-network must
      # be explicitly specified.
      arp-network: 192.168.0.0/24
    # (optional) BGP community aliases. Instead of using hard to
    # read BGP community numbers in address pool advertisement
    # configurations, you can define alias names here and use those
    # elsewhere in the configuration. The "no-export" community used
    # above is defined below.
    bgp-communities:
      # no-export is a well-known BGP community that prevents
      # re-advertisement outside of the immediate autonomous system,
      # but people don't usually recognize its numerical value. :)
      no-export: 65535:65281
