    # The peers section tells MetalLB what BGP routers to connect too. There
    # is one entry for each router you want to peer with.
    peers:
    - # The target IP address for the BGP session.
      peer-address: 10.0.0.1
      # The BGP AS number that MetalLB expects to see advertised by
      # the router.

      # The BGP AS number that MetalLB should speak as.

      # need to set this in production.

      # BGP reference material to understand what setting this implies.

    # The address-pools section lists the IP addresses that MetalLB is
    # allowed to allocate, along with settings for how to advertise
    # those addresses over BGP once assigned. You can have as many
    # address pools as you want.
    address-pools:      
    - # A name for the address pool. Services can request allocation
      # from a specific address pool using this name, by listing this
      # name under the 'metallb.universe.tf/address-pool' annotation.

      # A list of IP address ranges over which MetalLB has authority,

      # (optional) If true, MetalLB will not allocate any address that
      # ends in .0 or .255. Some old, buggy consumer devices
      # mistakenly block traffic to such addresses under the guise of
      # smurf protection. Such devices have become fairly rare, but
      # the option is here if you encounter serving issues.

      # (optional) If false, MetalLB will not automatically allocate
      # any address in this pool. Addresses can still explicitly be

      # A list of BGP advertisements to make. Each address that gets
      # assigned out of this pool will turn into this many
      # advertisements. For most simple setups, you'll probably just
      # want one.
      advertisements:
      - # (optional) How much you want to aggregate up the IP address
        # before advertising. For example, advertising 1.2.3.4 with
        # aggregation-length=24 would end up advertising 1.2.3.0/24.
        # For the majority of setups, you'll want to keep this at the
        # default of 32, which advertises the entire IP address
        # unmodified.
        aggregation-length: 32
        # (optional) The value of the BGP "local preference" attribute
        # for this advertisement. Only used with IBGP peers,
        # i.e. peers where peer-asn is the same as my-asn.
        localpref: 100
        # (optional) BGP communities to attach to this
        # advertisement. Communities are given in the standard
        # two-part form <asn>:<community number>. You can also use
        # alias names (see below).
        communities:
        - 64512:1
        - no-export
    # (optional) BGP community aliases. Instead of using hard to
    # read BGP community numbers in address pool advertisement
    # configurations, you can define alias names here and use those
    # elsewhere in the configuration. The "no-export" community used
    # above is defined below.
    communities:
      # no-export is a well-known BGP community that prevents
      # re-advertisement outside of the immediate autonomous system,
      # but people don't usually recognize its numerical value. :)
