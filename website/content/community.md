We would love to hear from you! Here are some places you can find us.

## Mailing list

Our mailing list
is
[metallb-users@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metallb-users). It's
for discussions around MetalLB usage, community support, and developer
discussion (although for the latter we mostly use Github directly).

## Slack

_Under construction! We're waiting for the Kubernetes Slack admins to
create the channel. Please use other communication methods for now._

<!-- For a more interactive experience, we have
the
[#metallb slack channel on k8s.slack.com](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/metallb/). If
you're not already logged into the Kubernetes slack organization,
you'll need to [request an invite](http://slack.k8s.io/) before you
can join. -->


## IRC

If you prefer a more classic chat experience, we're also on `#metallb`
on the Freenode IRC network. You can use
Freenode's
[web client](http://webchat.freenode.net?randomnick=1&channels=%23metallb&uio=d4) if
you don't already have an IRC client.

## Issue Tracker

Use
the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/google/metallb/issues)
to file bugs and features request. If you need support, please send
your questions to the metallb-users mailing list rather than filing a
GitHub issue.
